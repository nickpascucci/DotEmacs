  Mailcrypt 3.5.8 is Available for Download


  1.  Introduction

  Mailcrypt is an Emacs Lisp package which provides a simple interface
  to message encryption with PGP (you do use Emacs to handle your mail
  and news, right?).  The current version of Mailcrypt handles PGP 2.6.x,
  PGP 5.x, and GnuPG 1.x .


  2.  Features

  2.1. New in this Release

  This is mainly a bugfix release. Anonymous remailer support was updated to
  match modern remailers, and the GPG passphrase code was changed to cache
  by keyid instead of name, which will help folks who use multiple keys with
  the same name but different passphrases.


  2.2.	Stable Features for PGP 5.0 and GnuPG

  Support for GnuPG.  Key fetching/snarfing functionality for PGP 5.0.
  Messages from PGP 5.0 operations now resemble more closely the
  messages generated for version 2.6.  Encryption works correctly,
  even when the secret keyring is not available (a requested feature
  for paranoid types ;-).  Mixmaster and Cypherpunk remailers can be
  used in PGP 5.0 mode, if the user has an RSA key. Further updated
  documentation for support under various mail packages.


  2.3.	Features for PGP 2.6.x (stable)

  Encryption, decryption, signing, adding keys, extracting keys,
  passphrase caching with timeout, multiple secret key (identity)
  support, a simple but flexible interface to Cypherpunk remailers
  (including chaining, response blocks, pseudonyms, and Mixmaster
  support), and an automatic keyserver interface via HTTP.


  2.4.	Still To Do

  o  Fix signing of foreign-language emails under GNUS/Mule. Currently,
     foreign characters are preceded by a '\207' byte, which is
     present at signing, but stripped when messages are sent.

  o  Get Mailcrypt to work with PGP 5.0 on NT.

  o  Test Mailcrypt against PGP 6.5.

  o  Refine Mailcrypt schemes so that alternate backends, like Crypt++,
     can be used.

  o  Expand self-test framework.
