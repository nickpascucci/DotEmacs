# What is this directory?

This is where packages and elisp that are from 3rd party sources and
not in one of the package archives are stored. Generally, when new
packages are added to the package archive that were previously stored
here I remove the static versions and install the new ones from the
package archive. This helps things stay up to date and cleans up the
Git repo a bit.
