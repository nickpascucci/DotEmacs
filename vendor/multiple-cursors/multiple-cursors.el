;;; Commentary:

;; An experiment in multiple cursors for emacs. Still very much in beta.
;;
;; The basic concept works, but there are definitely some kinks to work out.

;; This extension is dependent on the mark-multiple library.
;;     https://github.com/magnars/mark-multiple.el

;; ** Usage

;; I've set up my key-bindings like so:
;;
;;     ;; Experimental multiple-cursors
;;     (global-set-key (kbd "C-S-c C-S-c") 'mc/add-multiple-cursors-to-region-lines)
;;     (global-set-key (kbd "C-S-c C-e") 'mc/edit-ends-of-lines)
;;     (global-set-key (kbd "C-S-c C-a") 'mc/edit-beginnings-of-lines)
;;
;; To get out of multiple-cursors-mode, press `C-g`.

;; ** Contribute

;; There's plenty wrong with this implementation still. I'm actively trying things
;; out, and also working on combining it with
;; [mark-multiple.el](https://github.com/magnars/mark-multiple.el) to get a more
;; comprehensive tool.
;;
;; Still, if you've got something to contribute, please do not hesitate to open
;; an issue, and we can take a look together before you dive into the elisp. :-)
;;
;; You'll find the repo at:
;;

;; ## Combining with mark-multiple
;;
;; Right now you can go from multiple marks to multiple cursors with C-g.
;;
;; The other way around is a bit more tricky:
;;
;;  * What to do about overlapping marks?
;;  * Expanding the marks should be possible, for instance using `mark-word` or
;;    `expand-region`
;;  * Killing or copying needs to keep a kill-ring for each cursor.
;;
;; So basically `mark-multiple` isn't ready for prime time as a full blown multiple
;; marks library. For this to work as expected, I think parts of mark-multiple
;; needs to be rewritten, and possibly integrated into multiple-cursors.
;;
;; For now, mark-multiple is an excellent tool to place your cursors where you need
;; them to be.

;;; Code:

(require 'multiple-cursors-core)
(require 'mc-edit-lines)
(require 'mc-mark-multiple-integration)
(require 'rectangular-region-mode)

(provide 'multiple-cursors)

;;; multiple-cursors.el ends here
